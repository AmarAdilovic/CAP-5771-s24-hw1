Question 5: 
 Consider the following dataset that contains the age and gender information for 9 users who visited a given website.
 
 Answers to each subquestion is a dictionary with keys:
 "bin1", "bin2", and "bin3". Each value is a list of integers.

 USERID | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4      | 5      | 6      | 7      | 8      | 9      |
 AGE    | 17     | 24     | 25     | 28     | 32     | 38     | 39     | 49     | 68     |

Question Notes:

'''

# a) Suppose you apply an equal interval width approach to discretize the Age attribute into 3 bins.
# Show the userIDs assigned to each of the 3 bins.
