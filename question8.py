Question 8:  Measures of Similarity and Dissimilarity 
 Consider the following bindary vectors:
    x1 = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
    x2 = (1, 1, 1, 0, 0)
    y1 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
    y2 = (0, 0, 0, 1, 1)
    y3 = (0, 1, 0, 1, 1)

 The answer to each subquestion should either be a list of two points or the string "equally similar".
 The two points are taken from 'x1', 'x2', 'y1', 'y2', 'y3'.
